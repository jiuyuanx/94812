They allow regulators to identify and address issues before they become widespread or cause significant harm. By reporting concerns or suspicious activities, whistleblowers and complainants can help regulators to identify areas where AI systems may be misaligned with ethical or legal standards, and to take corrective action\",\n          \"<s> ### Question: What are the economic, ethical, and strategic issues that call into question the continuation of collaboration on AI with China?\\n Briefly, in 100 words answer the question. ### Answer:  Economic issues include concerns about intellectual property theft and technology transfer.
